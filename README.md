Welcome to the Python for beginners workshop ðŸ’»

### Overview

This workshop talks about the basics of python programming.
We will go through python data structures, functions, exceptions and modules.

You can download python from python.org but if you haven't installed python yet, I recommend instead to download Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) as it includes the most useful libraries already.
If you don't have Anaconda, make sure to install pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
We will use pithon 3.x during this workshop (version 2.7 also available online).

### Why Python?

* It is a general purpose language

* Multipurpose programming language
